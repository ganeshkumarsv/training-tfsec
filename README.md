# Using tfsec with GitHub Actions

[tfsec](https://github.com/liamg/tfsec) is static analysis powered security scanner for your terraform code. This provides a way to analyze your TF to catch issues before they are applied. You do not want to find out about security issues after an _apply_. ;)

## Installation

See [tfsec docs](https://github.com/liamg/tfsec#installation).
